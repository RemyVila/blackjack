# blackjack
This is my first moderately large scale solo project I am working on. The goal is to create a server ran blackjack game that can be played with friends online.
I am currently working on the logic of the game with currently essentally no UI.
Once the game is fully functional I will create a UI to play with! Feel free to make additions / refactors / suggestions / critique. Whatever you like!
If any contributions are made I will test them on my local and if I like it then I will merge!
Thanks for looking at my work anyways!
